2. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
3. Follow the development setup and coding standards below
4. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- VS Code 1.95+
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/argus.git
cd argus

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npx tsc

# Launch Extension Development Host
# Press F5 in VS Code, or run:
code --extensionDevelopmentPath=.
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Compile first
npx tsc

# Run tests (requires VS Code test runner)
npm test
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Ensure the project compiles cleanly**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. **Add tests** for new functionality

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Sign your commits** using the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin):
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
   ```

6. **Push your branch** and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Fill out the PR template** completely

8. **Address review feedback** promptly

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Use strict TypeScript (`"strict": true`)
- Use type annotations for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var`

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Write JSDoc comments for public functions and classes
- Organize imports: node builtins, `vscode`, third-party, local

### Example

```typescript
/**
 * Parse a repository input string into a structured config.
 *
 * Accepts HTTPS URLs, SSH URLs, `platform:owner/repo`, or bare `owner/repo`.
 *
 * @param raw - The raw input string from the user.
 * @returns A parsed RepoConfig, or undefined if the input is invalid.
 */
export function parseRepoInput(raw: string): RepoConfig | undefined {
    const trimmed = raw.trim();
    if (!trimmed) {
        return undefined;
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat(forge): add GitLab merge request support
fix(security): handle malformed nonce in replay check
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```
